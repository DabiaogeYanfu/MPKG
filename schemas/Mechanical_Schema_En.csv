Multi-Stage Nitriding,Nitriding process performed at two or three different temperature stages
Denitriding,Heat treatment process to remove excess nitrogen from nitrided surface layer
Nitrides,Compounds formed between nitrogen and metallic elements-common examples include γ-Fe4N-ε-Fe2-3N-ζ-Fe2N
Nitriding Potential,Parameter indicating the ability of nitrogen-containing medium to achieve specific surface nitrogen content at given temperature
Nitriding Depth,Distance from surface to visible boundary between nitrided layer and base material
